Description: This package implement descriptive tools and function to handle multiplex networks into the
    R framework. Multiplex networks are composed by a multiplicity of
    overlapping layers that capture different types of connection between nodes
    and account for both relationships within a same layer
    and relationships between a same node located in different layers of the overall
    network. Some of the most common descriptors, clustering indices and centrality
    measures can be calculated starting from a set of nodes and layers given in
    input by the user.
