Description: This package allows to implement multiplex networks into the
    R framework. Multiplex networks are networks composed of a multiplicity of
    overlapping nets that capture the different types of connection between nodes
    within the network, taking into account both relationships within a same layer
    and relationships between a same node located in different layers of the overall
    network. Some of the most common descriptors, clustering indices and centrality
    measures can be calculated starting from a set of nodes and layers given in
    input by the user.
